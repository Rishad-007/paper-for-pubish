# Hybrid Economic Policy Analysis

A comprehensive framework combining LSTM neural networks, Double Machine Learning, and Causal Forest methodologies for robust economic policy impact assessment.

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a novel hybrid approach to economic policy analysis by integrating three state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies:

- **LSTM Neural Networks** for macroeconomic time series forecasting
- **Double Machine Learning (DML)** for causal effect estimation
- **Causal Forest** for heterogeneous treatment effect analysis
- **Hybrid Ensemble** for integrated policy recommendations

The framework uses **real US economic data** from authoritative sources (FRED API, BLS, Business Dynamics Statistics) to analyze the causal impact of tax policy changes on firm survival rates.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-Model Integration**: Combines forecasting, causal inference, and heterogeneity analysis
- **Robust Causal Inference**: Uses Double ML with cross-fitting to eliminate confounding bias
- **Heterogeneous Effects**: Discovers how policy impacts vary across economic conditions
- **Ensemble Weighting**: Data-driven combination of model predictions

### 📊 **Publication-Ready Outputs**

- **5 Summary Tables**: Descriptive statistics, model performance, policy impacts
- **3 High-Quality Figures**: Model architecture, data overview, results visualization

## � Expected Output Formats

The hybrid analysis framework produces three main types of quantitative outputs:

### 1. Policy Impact Quantification

The framework provides detailed quantitative assessment of policy impacts with confidence intervals:

```json
{
  "tax_cut_2%": {
    "causal_effect_on_survival": 0.0245, // 2.45% increase in survival
    "confidence_interval": [0.0089, 0.0401],
    "affected_firms": 18500,
    "economic_conditions": "growth_responsive"
  },
  "tax_increase_3%": {
    "causal_effect_on_survival": -0.0189, // 1.89% decrease in survival
    "confidence_interval": [-0.0356, -0.0022],
    "affected_firms": 12300,
    "economic_conditions": "recession_sensitive"
  },
  "aggressive_tax_cut_5%": {
    "causal_effect_on_survival": 0.0512, // 5.12% increase in survival
    "confidence_interval": [0.0234, 0.079],
    "affected_firms": 25000,
    "economic_conditions": "universally_positive"
  }
}
```

## 🗂️ Unified Thesis Asset Management

All figures, tables, models, summaries, and data snapshots used in the thesis are now consolidated under a single structured directory: `thesis_images/` (created automatically).

### Directory Layout

```
thesis_images/
├── figures/          # All static visual assets (PNG/SVG/PDF)
├── tables/           # CSV tables (plus optional JSON metadata)
├── data_snapshots/   # Intermediate / snapshot datasets
├── models/           # Serialized model artifacts
├── summaries/        # Executive narrative or JSON summaries
└── manifests/        # Auto-generated manifest (JSON + CSV)
```

### Naming Convention

Each asset follows:

```
<section>__<short_descriptor>__v<major.minor>.<ext>
```

Examples:

```
forecasting__lstm_training_history__v1.0.png
policy_analysis__policy_impact_quantification__v1.0.csv
causal_inference__causal_forest_feature_importance__v1.0.csv
```

Sections currently used (heuristic mapping):

- `forecasting`
- `causal_inference`
- `policy_analysis`
- `model_evaluation`
- `general`

### Manifest

The file `thesis_images/manifests/asset_manifest.json` (and CSV) contains structured metadata for every registered asset:

Fields:

```
id, category, section, name, version, filename, path, created_at, tags, description, source_code_reference
```

You can load it in Python:

```python
import json, pandas as pd
with open('thesis_images/manifests/asset_manifest.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
manifest_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
manifest_df.head()
```

### Programmatic Saving

Use the `ThesisAssetManager` to save future assets directly:

```python
from thesis_asset_manager import ThesisAssetManager
assets = ThesisAssetManager().ensure()

# After creating a matplotlib plot:
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1,2,3],[2,3,4])
assets.save_figure(fig, section='forecasting', name='example_trend', description='Demo figure', tags=['demo','forecasting'])

# Saving a table (pandas DataFrame):
assets.save_table(df, section='model_evaluation', name='new_performance_metrics', version='1.1', description='Updated metrics')

# Saving a textual or JSON summary:
assets.save_summary({'result': 'positive', 'ate': 0.024}, section='policy_analysis', name='tax_cut_summary')
```

### Retroactive Organization

Existing artifacts were imported using `organize_thesis_assets.py`. Re-run if new legacy exports are added:

```bash
python organize_thesis_assets.py
```

### Updating an Asset

Increment the version (e.g. `v1.1`) when a figure or table is regenerated with meaningful changes. The manifest automatically deduplicates the `(category, section, name, version)` combination.

### Referencing in Thesis Text

Because each filename embeds its semantic meaning, you can directly cite:

- Figure: `forecasting__hybrid_model_results__v1.0.png`
- Table: `policy_analysis__policy_impact_quantification__v1.0.csv`

This ensures stable, unambiguous references in manuscript drafts.

### Benefits

- Centralized, versioned, and searchable assets
- Stable naming for citation and LaTeX inclusion
- Automated manifest for cross-referencing and reproducibility
- Extensible: add new categories or metadata fields via `thesis_asset_manager.py`

### Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- Automatic LaTeX table & figure snippet generation
- Hash-based change detection to auto-bump versions
- Inline notebook widget to browse and insert asset references

---

For any new analysis step, prefer using the asset manager methods instead of ad-hoc `plt.savefig` or `DataFrame.to_csv` calls to maintain consistency.
